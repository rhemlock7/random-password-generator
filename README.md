## Description
An employer needed to ensure their employees had secure passwords for sensitive information. The passwords needed to meet specific character requirements and be randomly generated.

### Characters You Can Include
You can include or exclude any of the characters below:
- Lowercase Letters
- Uppercase Letters
- Numbers
- Special Characters (!@#$%^&*<>?)
